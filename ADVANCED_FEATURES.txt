List of advanced features we implemented:

1. Server Pinging and Disconnect clients
		We implemented this feature but it really screwed up our shell
		tests, so we have the code available within bl-server.c
		commented out so our tests will pass. There seems to be a 
		timing/output issue with the tests. 
2. Binary Server Log File (with bl-showlog.c)
		with Makefile target bl-showlog
